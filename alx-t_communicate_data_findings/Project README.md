# Laptop Dataset
## by Terri-Lee Meyer


## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 1303 laptops, 
including brand, processor infomation, price and other laptop specifications. 
The dataset can be found in the repository for 37 Degrees' datasets 
[here](https://github.com/37Degrees/DataSets/blob/master/laptops.csv)


## Summary of Findings
There was a strong relationship between physical components like 
the RAM size and Screen Size which had an influence on the weight 
while the laptop category or CPU Brand presented findings of how it 
can have an effect on the overall price of a laptop.

Laptop categories are preferential to user ability of the laptop.
However, there is a trend to which Screen Size, RAM Size, CPU Speed 
and CPU Brand could be used per category. This could include fact such as
Gaming and Workstation laptops are commonly priced higher than other 
categories with Gaming laptops contributing to the highest price 
with the Razer laptops. As well as 2GHz to 3.5GHz being a basis
for CPU speed for higher performing laptops such as Gaming.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I focused mostly on RAM size and 
Screen size and using comparison variables like weight, 
price, cpu speed and laptop categories. 
And explored laptop categories as a whole in comparison to price, 
weight and cpu speed as well as CPU brand for interest sake 

Note: To make the presentation an easier read I incorporated 
a couple of the plots into subplots compared to the 
separate plots I created in the exploration analysis
